## Reaction Type Classifier

This project develops a machine learning model to classify chemical reaction descriptions into three types: Addition, Substitution, and Elimination.

The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process reaction descriptions and a Random Forest classifier for prediction.

## Features

Text preprocessing using TF-IDF vectorization

Model training with Random Forest classifier

Evaluation using classification metrics and confusion matrix visualization

Predict new reaction types from raw text input

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk seaborn matplotlib

## How to Run

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reaction-type-classifier.git

Open the Jupyter notebook file reaction_classifier.ipynb.

Run all cells step-by-step to train the model and see predictions.

To test the model with your own input, use the provided predict_reaction() function in the notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset (dataset.csv) contains sample chemical reaction descriptions and their corresponding reaction types. It is a small, synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes.
